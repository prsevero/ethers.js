# ethers.js

**Project under development.**

This project will be used to develop my web3 skills, with the ethers.js v6 library.

Built with [`ethers.js v6`](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/), [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/) and [`Tailwind`](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The project has two default wallets (Hierarchal Deterministic Wallet), and the user can also create a custom one.

It is also possible to do transfers between all the wallets, and it will keep and show the history of transactions.

Demo link coming soon.

If you have any doubt, I will be glad to help, just ping me.

*It uses the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, and **the tokens does not have any value**, but it simulates a real blockchain environment.*
