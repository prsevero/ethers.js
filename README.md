# ethers.js v6

**Project under development.**

## Demo

You can access the project [here](https://ethersjs.prsevero.com.br/).

## Overview

This project utilizes ethers.js to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It features the following functionalities:

- **Default Wallets**: The project includes two default Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets (HD Wallets) pre-configured for immediate use. Additionally, users have the flexibility to create custom wallets tailored to their preferences.
- **Transaction Management**: Users can perform transfers between any of the wallets included in the project. The app records and displays the transaction history of the session.

## Important notes

- **Testnet Usage**: The project operates on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet. It's crucial to note that the tokens used within this environment hold no real-world value. Instead, they serve to simulate a genuine blockchain environment for testing and development purposes.

## Improvements

- Enhance transactions history table with headers and include `from` and `to` fields
